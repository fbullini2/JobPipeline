please note 2 different concepts; JobAlertEmail and JobOffer; One JobAlertEmail can contain 1 or more JobOffers; The alert email contains
  often only few information about some jobs, often in the title of the mail it's already stated that there are more jobs offers in that
  email, but it's NOT a strict rule and often they doesn't contain the name of the company that need the job position, but only the
  recuiterCompany (liek Cadremploi) that sent the JobAlertEmail; please make this 2 concept very distinct, with the related structures;
